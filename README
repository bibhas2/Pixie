This is my attempt to write a decent and high performance
proxy server and not have to use Charles proxy.

Building
========
Clone these two repos somewhere:

git clone https://github.com/bibhas2/Cute.git
git clone https://github.com/bibhas2/Pixie.git

Go into the Cute folder and run:

make

Go into the Pixie folder and run:

make

Running
=======
There is a sample command line version of the server that you can run before
any GUI is developed.

Configure proxy setting to localhost:8080.

Run pixie:

./pixie
