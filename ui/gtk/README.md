##Overview
This is the Gtk+ version of the Pixie GUI. Should work in Linux. Hopefully, I can also build this in Mac
without having to build a Mac specific GUI.

##Build Instructions
You will need to have libgtk 3.x installed for this program to build. In Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
```

Then run make.
